# User list

In the Zulip web and desktop app, the right sidebar shows a list of users in
your organization. The user list has up to three section:

- **In this conversation**: Recent participants in the conversation you're viewing.
- **In this channel** or **Others in this channel**: Subscribers to the channel you're viewing.
- **Others**: Everyone else.

In organizations with up to 600 users, everyone is shown. In larger
organizations, only users who have been active in the last two weeks are shown,
but everyone is included when you [search](#filter-users).
[Deactivated users](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user) and
[bots](/help/bots-overview) are not listed.

To avoid distraction, you can [hide](#show-or-hide-the-user-list) the user list
any time.
